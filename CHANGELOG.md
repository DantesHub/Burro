# Changelog

## 0.4.1 — Unreleased

- Keep remote Claude chats active while their subagents or session-owned background commands are still running, even when the parent registry reports idle. Preserve permission requests, reject old/completed worker evidence, and suppress unread Done until work finishes.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-28

First public source release.

- Native worktree inventory with conservative Keep, Review, and Safe candidate assessments.
- Codex and Claude Code monitoring, unread completion tracking, worker grouping, and provider chat navigation.
- Minimal hover-driven notch with stable rows during interaction and Reduce Motion support.
- Explicit SSH monitoring for other laptops and servers, with last-seen states on connection failure.
- Dark butter app icon generated locally and applied at launch.
- MIT license, contribution/security guidance, synthetic fixtures, and macOS/Linux CI.

This is an early-stage source release. There are no prebuilt notarized binaries, automatic updates, or worktree deletion actions.
